1. A company wants to block phishing messages—predict whether an email is spam or not spam.
    
    - The model I would use is the logistic regression model because it estimates the probability 
      of an event occuring based on a given dataset of independent variables. 

2. Doctors want an objective second opinion on imaging results—predict whether an MRI shows cancerous growth.

    - The model I would use would fall in the classification category and would use either Support Vector
      Machines (finds a hyper-plane that creates a boundary between types of data) or the KNeighbors Classifier 
      (makes classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point). 

3. Farmers want improved weather forecasts—predict whether it will rain the next day.

    - The model I would most likely use is the linear regression model since it can model relationships between 
      a dependant variable with a given set of independent variables

4. A venture capital firm wants to optimize its investments—predict whether a company will undertake an IPO in the next 12 months.

    - The model I would use is the logistic regression model because it estimates the probability 
      of an event occuring based on a given dataset of independent variables.
